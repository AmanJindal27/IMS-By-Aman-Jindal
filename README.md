# Inventory Management System Using JSON File Systems 
## By-Aman_Jindal
This is a basic inventory management system program using python.

This repository was created in order to submit the project about IMS(Inventory Management System) to Elite Techno Group's Skill India Python ML/AI Internship.


I have created Inventory Management System using JSON file system to store all the data. 

# Steps Involved :
          - At first I have written a code to create a json file for products to access with some initial values.
    
          - Then second part involved accessing the json file, In this I have added multiple feature to interact with the user in a proper user-friendly manner.
          
          - On executing the second ,the user can do his shopping activity with the interface I have created using python. 
          
          - Proper bill would be shown as well as it stores that in transaction.json file.
          
          - Inventory.json file shows the inventory of items.
          
          - It all shows the total time taken by user while ordering and accessing the inventory.

# Output Of Inventory Management System: 

The user is given with access to see the inventory items and then place an order using GUI, automatic bill generation, and displaying the total time spent by the user while ordering and accessing the inventory and transaction history of the user gets stored in the transaction.json file.

# a) Displaying The User Mode through which user can access the inventory.
